Project title: Incident Disclosure Report to Mock Board of Directors
Course: IT Auditing and Risk Management

This repository contains a simulation of an Incident-Disclosure-Mock-Report prepared for the Board of Directors of Flair Airlines regarding a cybersecurity incident involving unauthorized access to the company's web server due to AndroxGh0st malware. The report highlights relevant federal regulations such as HIPAA, GLBA, SOX, and GDPR, assessing potential liabilities to customers, shareholders, and the government.

Key findings indicate Flair Airlines could be liable under GLBA and GDPR for compromised personal information, and under SOX for impacts on financial reporting. The report emphasizes the importance of transparency, compliance with federal regulations, and investment in robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard customer data and maintain stakeholder trust.

This mock report serves as a valuable resource for understanding the implications of cybersecurity incidents in a corporate setting within IT auditing and cybersecurity analytics.
